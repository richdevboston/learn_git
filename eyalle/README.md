Hangman-SelfPY
====  
  
This is a Python implementation of the game Hangman.
Inside the Hangman's directory, you can read more on how to run the game.
In order for the game to run, you will need to install its requirements (see its README to know how)
  
Rock Paper Scissors
======  
This is my implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors exercise.
This code stores every hand's possible options in a dictionary.
Every key in the dictionary has a key and the values are the key's winning and losing options.
A user will pass a selected hand, while the other hand is selected randomly.
