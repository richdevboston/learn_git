# learn_git
introduction to working with git &amp; github, contributors will be able to create programs, make fixes, and commit messages

goal
====  
  
each contributor is assigned to create 3 programs  
in this repository and wait for other users to review and test them.  
  
how to
======  
  
1) ask the repo's owner to add your username as a contributor(you can also fork the repo)  
after you've been approved, clone the repo  
create an issue in the github repo with your name  
![open_issue](https://github.com/yehonadav/learn_git/blob/master/images/open_issue.JPG?raw=true)  
![open_issue2](https://github.com/yehonadav/learn_git/blob/master/images/open_issue2.JPG?raw=true)  
![assign_and_comment](https://github.com/yehonadav/learn_git/blob/master/images/assign_and_comment.JPG?raw=true)  
  
2) create a local git branch with your username  
create a directory with your username, create any 3 programs you like and make sure they run correctly  
create a README.md file explaining your programs, what to install and how to run them  
  
3) commit your code changes  
* make sure to include a clear commit message! including the issue your currently working on, in all your commits!!!  
create an upstream branch with your username  
push your commit to the upstream branch  
  
4) in your github issue, add a comment saying your branch is ready for review  
find another open issue with the same type of comment, and assign yourself for that issue  
  
5) fetch and checkout to the issue's branch and set your correct upstream branch  
test the issue's programs  
if you encounter defects, make a hotfix local branch and fix them & commit, then merge it to the issu's branch  
update the issue's branch and make sure there are no conflicts  
update the master branch and merge the issue's commits into it  
push commits to master branch  
delete issue's local &amp; remote branches  
  
6) in the github issue, add a comment saying the review and test acceptance has been successful, and close the issue  
  
7) re-open your issue  
  
8) comment and say you want to add another python program that uses the requests module to crawl html data  
  
9) go to some other re-opened issue, comment and assign yourself  
  
10) if you are the first to assign to that issue, describe the program your creating in detail, what functions you need, and create a remote+local branch with the issue's name  
if your the 2nd assignee, comment on the functions you will develop, and create a local branch tracking the remote branch of the issue  
  
11) collaborate and create the program  
  
12) merge your code to the remote branch  

13) if you are the last merger, merge the issue's branch to the master branch  
  
14) redo the steps 9-13
